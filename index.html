    <p> My name is Sami Luke and I am a current Master’s in Library Science student at Wayne State University. This website will serve as a portfolio of some of the work I have done in my MLIS, my undergraduate career, and in the library I work at. My ultimate goal after graduation is to become a Cataloging Librarian in order to facilitate discovery for everybody at the library. I am passionate about the power of naming and describing library items because this power can determine a person’s ability to find items in the library catalog and therefore use those items. Libraries provide items and information for all kinds of needs, so it is absolutely essential that people are able to find the information they are seeking. People depend on the library to help them find information that can sometimes be life changing and not being able to find that information could be potentially destructive. Consequently, my professional goal is to become a Cataloging Librarian that thinks of the ways the user is searching the catalog.</p>
