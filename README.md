# Sami Luke's INF6420 Project

A portfolio of wrtiting and classwork.

## Wireframes

Here are wireframes of a potential layout for my portfolio website.

![Wireframe of home page](Wireframes/IMG_1926.jpeg)

Header- This will have my navigation menu of the website along with my name/title of the website.


Navigation menu- this will have links to my undergraduate work, work from my MLIS, my resume, and contact page.

Main content- here I will describe myself and my future goals in relation to my career.

Footer- Contact info again, Linkedin, and copyright info (although I am not entirely sure what copyright info I will need to include).

Header-Will remain the same across the entire website.

Navigation menu-Will remain the same across the website.

Main content- Here I will want to include the work that I value the msot from my undergraduate career. I want to include my senior thesis, or at least a PDF attatchment as well as some of my audio journalism. 

Footer- Will remain the same across the website.

Header-Will remain the same across the entire website.

Navigation menu-Will remain the same across the website.

Main content-Here I want to put my email addresses (may potentially get rid of the contact page and just use this page, I am unsure still). After that I want to list my education, work experience, awards/scholarships, etc. I essentially want to put all of the information on my resume on my website in a nice easily digestible page.
